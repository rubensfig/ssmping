.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ssmping
and
.B ssmpingd
are network level multicast management tools that can be used to check whether
one can receive multicast packets via SSM from a host.
The host target given to
.B ssmping
must run the
.B ssmpingd
daemon, which listens on UDP port
.B 4321
for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast requests.
When it receives one, it responds to a well known SSM multicast group which
.B ssmping
just have joined.
Depending on whether the request was made with IPv4 or IPv6, the group is
.B 232.43.211.234
or
.B ff3e::4321:1234
respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
For
.B ssmpingd
there are no options.
For
.B ssmping
the options are as follows.
.TP
.B \-4
Force IPv4
.TP
.B \-6
Force IPv6
.TP

Print client and server version information.
.TP
\fB-I\fR \fIinterface\fR
Interface to join on
.TP
\fB-c\fR \fIcount\fR
Stop after sending (and receiving)
.I count
requests (and replies)
.TP
\fB-s\fR \fIsize\fR

bytes
.SH SEE ALSO

\fBssmping\fR and \fBssmpingd\fR were developed by Stig Venaas during the
early days of the m6bone, the IPv6 multicast backbone.
